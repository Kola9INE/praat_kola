A SHORT PRAAT SCRIPT TO OBTAIN MEAN DISTIBUTION OF VOWELS' FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY

- A short recording was done in the Yorùbá langauge in a professional recording room (although with the inbuilt microphone of a Windows 11 Pro Dell)
- Annotation was done on four tiers (Transcript, word, syllable and vowels)
- Vowels were properly tone marked phonetically to reflect the three distinct tones of the Yorùbá language.
- Original script was obtained from https://github.com/wendyelviragarcia/vowels/blob/master/analyzes_vowels_extracts_f0_f1_f2_f3_f4_int_dur.praat but modified for a more specific purpose.
- Script was run and result was obtained as intended (the mean values per interval-label on the vowel tier), saved on a .txt file.

# This was done as an examination while running my Masters Program in the Computational Linguistics at the University of Ibadan.
